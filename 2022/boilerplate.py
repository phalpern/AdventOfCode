# Usage: puzzleXX.Y.py [input-suffix]
#
# Where XX is the puzzle number in decimal (with leading zero, if necessary)
# and Y is the sub-part (1 or 2).  By default, the input-suffix is "input", so
# the input file would be "puzzleXX_input.txt".  Note that the input to the two
# parts of one puzzle is typically the same file, so Y does not show up in the
# default input file name.
